Capstone Project: Emerging IT Skills Analysis
Project Overview

This repository contains my final capstone project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. The project aims to analyze and identify the most in-demand programming skills, leveraging data from various sources to provide actionable insights for this year's report on emerging IT skills.

Project Steps
Data Collection:
1. Extracted data from job postings, training portals, and surveys.
2. Aggregated data in formats such as .csv files, Excel sheets, and databases.
   
Data Wrangling:
1. Cleaned and prepared data using advanced data wrangling techniques with Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
2. Ensured data quality and consistency.
   
Trend Analysis:
1. Analyzed the data to identify key insights and trends.
   
Focused on:
1. Top programming languages in demand
2. Essential database skills
3. Popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
   
Statistical Techniques:
1. Applied statistical methods to uncover meaningful insights.
2. Used various Python libraries like (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn, BeautifulSoup, ect) for statistical analysis.
   
Data Visualization:
1. Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
2. Developed an interactive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics & Google Looker Studio.
   
Presentation:
1. Compiled insights into a comprehensive presentation.
2. Highlighted key findings to support data-driven decision-making.
   
Tools and Technologies:
1. Python for data scraping, cleaning, and analysis
2. Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
4. IBM Cognos Analytics for interactive dashboards
5. Data visualization and storytelling
   
Repository Contents:
1. Data Collection: Scripts and tools for data scraping and API integration.
2. Data Wrangling: Notebooks and scripts for data cleaning and preparation using Python.
3. Analysis: Notebooks and scripts for statistical analysis and trend identification using Python.
4. Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn visualizations, and IBM Cognos Analytics dashboard.
5. Presentation: Final presentation with insights and trends.

This capstone project provided valuable insights into the most in-demand programming skills and trends in the IT industry. 
It was an enriching experience that enhanced my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
